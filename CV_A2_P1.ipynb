Your deliverable should be in the form of a Jupyter Notebook in which you describe what you did in each problem and why. Include all your relevant code segments as well as your explanations and results figures. I highly encourage you to write the report as you are working on the solution, and not leave the report till the end, because that would just increase the amount of effort required.\n",
